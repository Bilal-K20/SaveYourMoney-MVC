# SaveYourMoney-MVC

#What is this project about?
SaveYourMoney is precisely designed to transform the landscape of personal finance management. I was inspired to create this during COVID. Using excel for personal finance was great however I wanted to make it even easier to use by not worrying about any formulas. Fundamentally, the platform facilitates an easy-to-use and friendly interface, specifically designed to tailor the process of tracking expenses.

#Features 
One of SaveYourMoneyâ€™s highlighting features lies in its customization capabilities, empowering users to shape their financial journey with serious precision. SaveYourMoney gives individuals the ability to alter and create categories according to their own preferences. Additionally, it provides a lot of flexibility by giving them the option to set a budget to a designated category with the objective of allowing users to make their budgets align with their lifestyle. In other words it also empowers users to gain a better understanding of their spending habits as well as gaining better control. 

SaveYourMoney is a dynamic financial tool designed to create a story with the use of data visualisation techniques to help gain a thorough understanding rather than just being a passive tool for tracking expenses. SaveYourMoney captures data based on the type of transaction a user has and based on the category it sits in. Lastly if there is a budget set for specific category then the financial report will state if the net flow is overbudget. The interactive mixture of charts will help users analyse data effectively resulting in strategic financial planning.
